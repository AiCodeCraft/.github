# Welcome to AiCodecraft

**A hub for ethical AI, web development, and digital innovation.**

As Rick Sanchez once said: "I'm a scientist; because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it\!" While he might have stolen my motto, it's okayâ€”he's freaky enough to use it. ðŸ˜„

I love exploring, I love tools, and yes, AI is a tool, too. I love to battle with them in abstract coding challenges. It's a lot of fun, but sometimes it gets a little crazy. That's why I decided to publish my work with trained LLMs, MLs, and other AI-related projects here, away from my main account. On my main profile, I focus on the serious reality of my professional work. Here at AiCodecraft, it's a project for teaching and learning from AI. I would be honored if you want to travel with me on this awesome journey.

## Philosophy & Projects

My work here follows a simple rule: **Code with purpose, build with ethics.**

I believe AI is a tool, and like any tool, it's about how you use it. From building the sleek **OnionHosting** theme to crafting security best practices, every project is a step towards a more transparent and responsible digital future.
