# Welcome to AiCodecraft ðŸ’»

**A hub for ethical AI, web development, and digital innovation.**

I'm building something I believe in, and I know I'm not the only one. AiCodecraft is my personal workshopâ€”a place where I explore the intersection of AI, security, and web development. Like many of you, I've seen projects lose steam when the team fades away. That's why I'm focusing on an open, transparent process and sharing everything I learn.

Here, I publish all the themes, code snippets, and solutions I've built with AI. This isn't just a collection of repos; it's a living log of my work, a resource for fellow builders, and a place to showcase what's possible with ethical, powerful AI tools.

## Your AI Toolkit: A Starting Guide

If you're new to AI-driven development or just want to see what tools are out there, I've compiled a quick reference guide to the key players in the AI space. These are the tools I use and trust for my own projects.

| AI Model/Platform | Description & Use Case | Official Documentation & API |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Google Gemini** | A powerful, multimodal AI for complex tasks, from code generation to creative writing. | [Link to Gemini Docs](https://ai.google.dev/docs) |
| **OpenAI (GPT)** | The standard-bearer for conversational AI, well-known for its strong language and coding capabilities. | [Link to OpenAI Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) |
| **Mistral AI** | A European company known for its focus on highly efficient and open models. Great for performance-sensitive tasks. | [Link to Mistral Docs](https://docs.mistral.ai/) |
| **Deepseek** | A strong, open-source model with a focus on code and programming-related tasks. | [Link to Deepseek GitHub](https://github.com/deepseek-ai) |
| **Anthropic (Claude)** | Known for its ethical principles and long context windows, excellent for analyzing long documents or books. | [Link to Claude Docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/) |
| **Llama (Meta)** | A series of open-source models released by Meta, popular for local development and research. | [Link to Llama Docs](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://llama.meta.com/llama3) |

## Philosophy & Projects

My work here follows a simple rule: **Code with purpose, build with ethics.**

I believe AI is a tool, and like any tool, it's about how you use it. From building the sleek **OnionHosting** theme to crafting security best practices, every project is a step towards a more transparent and responsible digital future. You can find all my public projects [here on my GitHub profile](https://github.com/VolkanSah).

Let's build something great together.
