# Welcome to AiCodecraft

**A hub for ethical AI, web development, and digital innovation.**

AiCodecraft is my personal workshop—a place where I explore the intersection of AI, security, and web development. Everything here is shared openly: code snippets, themes, solutions, and experiments with AI. This isn’t just a collection of repos; it’s a living log of what’s possible when AI is used responsibly.

## Philosophy & Projects

**Rule #1:** Code with purpose, build with ethics.  

I treat AI as a tool. How you use it defines its impact. Every project—from sleek **Hosting themes** to security best practices—is a step toward a transparent, responsible digital future.
